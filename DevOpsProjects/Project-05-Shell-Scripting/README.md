# **SHELL SCRIPTING**

This my [Darey.io](https://darey.io/) 

## Intro to Shell Scripting Project

In this project I learned that shell scripts are a series of bash commands and instructions that are preformed in sequential order in a shell to handle repetitive tasks. These scripts are written and stored in text files with the .sh extension.

### **Shell Scripting Syntax Elements**

#### 1. Variables: 

    stored data types such as numbers, strings, and arrays

Values can be assigned to a variable by using the (=) operator
they can be called upon using the variable name with the $ sign before it.

#### 2. Control Flow:

    Flow statements like if-else,for loops, while loops, and case statements allow  decision making, list iteration, and execute commands based on conditions

#### 3. Command Substitution:

    Allows the capture of output of a command to be used within the script

    A backtick or the $() syntax command substitutions

#### 4. Input & Output:

    The read command can be used to accept user input and output to text using the echo command.

    Using operators such as:
     > (outputs to a file)
     < (input from a file)
     | (pipes the output from one command as the input to another command)

#### 5. Functions:

    Functions allow you to define and group related commands together, make your code reuseable
